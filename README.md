Lip Inspired Passive Jamming Gripper is a soft grip that can adapt to objects with complex shapes and grasp objects through re-grasping motions. However, its performance in grasping soft objects can continue to improve. Therefore, our project aims to improve the performance of the Lip Inspired Passive Jamming gripper when grasping different deformable objects by adjusting the jaw angle through the feedback of the motor.

After implementing the controller, the gripper has shown good performance for objects with different softness.

At the same time, we also collected the acceleration signal feedback of the gripper. We found that for objects with different softness, the feedback acceleration signal of the gripper after contact with the object's surface has a certain variation pattern.
